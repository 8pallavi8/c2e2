    <p>Welcome to the self assessment Building Energy Efficiency Tool (BEET). This tool was created under the framework of the Euroclima+ program by the Copenhagen Centre of Energy Efficiency (C2E2), an Energy Efficiency hub institutionally part of the UNEP
        DTU Partnership.<br><br> The Energy Sustainable Municipal Buildings project is funded by Euroclima +, the flagship cooperation program of the European Union for environmental sustainability and climate change in Latin America. In Argentina, the
        French Development Agency (AFD) is in charge of the implementation. The National University of La Plata (UNLP) is the entity responsible and leader of the project for its execution. The Red Argentina de Municipios frente al Cambio Climático (RAMCC)
        and the Copenhagen Center for Energy Efficiency (C2E2) are the strategic partners for the realization of the project.
        <br><br>
        <b>Euroclima+</b><br> Euroclima+ is an EU financed program that intends to promote climate change mitigation and adaptation actions in Latin American countries.<br> <br>

        <b>UNEP DTU Partnership (UDP)</b><br> UNEP DTU Partnership (UDP) is a leading international research and advisory institution on energy, climate and sustainable development. It is an independent Centre within the Department for Management at the
        Technical University of Denmark (DTU)
        <br><br>

        <b>Copenhagen Centre for Energy Efficiency</b><br> Copenhagen Centre on Energy Efficiency (Copenhagen Centre) is dedicated to accelerating the uptake of energy efficiency policies and actions at a global scale.<br><br>

        <b>About BEET</b><br> This self assessment Building Energy Efficiency Tool (BEET) is designed to provide individual users a preliminary rapid assessment platform where they can assess their building energy performance. The overall objective of
        BEET is three fold:<br> a. Support the development of a rapid assessment of the energy performance of individual buildings;
        <br> b. Create a comparative evaluation between the baseline energy performance with energy efficiency (EE) standards.
        <br> c. Share recommendations of potential EE measures across building components and systems.
        <br> The tool is intended to cater to the needs of municipalities and relevant stakeholders. The tool may be used for overall understanding of impact on overall building energy consumption profile with respect to various system and component level
        parameters. The target users may be energy managers, analysts, maintenance and operation professionals, technicians and any individual with basic know-how on buildings and energy efficiency.
    </p>

    <b>Disclaimer</b>
    <p>The objective of the tool is to provide an indicative and holistic outcome on the building energy efficiency based on the user's input data. The tool does not replace the simulations and assessments from a full fledged tools and licensed software
        available in the market. The output results hence is recommended to be used for reference purpose only and may not be used for detailed or investment grade design and implementation activities. <br> The tool is built based on technical literature
        data, available global and local standards, tool developers' knowledge and experience in the sector. Care has been taken to deliver the most possibly suitable platform. However, due to the challenges in availability of country specific data with
        respect to climate files, building envelope standards, equipment and appliances, energy efficiency applications, operations, technology and related resources, etc. we understand that there may be certain differences with other similar available
        online and licensed tools. All the assumptions have been listed in the Assumptions page.<br> The information shared in this form will be used to asses the building performance and potential savings through energy efficient measures. Should there
        be any feedback / queries / suitable or customized data integration requirements, please do reach out to us at the below mentioned contact.<br><br>

                        <br> * If the “No, I don’t know” option is selected, appropriate average/efficiency/benchmark values are loaded to the tool based on location, building type and preceding answers in the tool. These values are adopted as applicable
                        from several published and widely referred sources such as Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation – Argentina, University of La Plata – Argentina, ASHRAE standards, U.S. Energy Information Administration, U.S. Department

                        <br> * Envelope convective heat transfer is not considered<br> * Envelope solar gain is not considered, except for windows<br> * The building is treated as a single thermal zone
                        <br> * Occupied hours first fill weekdays symmetrically around noon, and then fill weekends
                        <br> Infiltration is assumed zero during occupied times (vac pressurization)
                        <br> * Airside economizer operates only when full cooling load can be met - no partial economizer with mechanical cooling<br> * Lights and plug loads are assumed to be at 1/20 power density during unoccupied times<br> * There is
                        no energy consumption calculated for hot water heating. There is no energy calculated for hot water hydronic pumping<br> * Air system is in variable volume setting by default unless the user chooses "No" option. * Window area is
                        equally distributed on N,S,E,W exposures. Window to Wall ratio does ratio default inputs does not consider impact on lighting energy.

                        However, relatively highest and better efficiency values are available in the market. Please reach out to us, if you do have such values. We will integrate the same into the tool.
                        <br> * At times, average most efficient values are considered for calculation when the user selects option B, i.e. if the user does not know the value.

                        the higher U values i.e. for summer are being considered for calculations for Option B, Option C selection.
                        <br> * Section 5.1: Option B, standard average efficiencies are considered. Also, for electrical radiators, only equipment efficiency is considered as 100% since entire electricity input is converted to heat energy. However its
                        real usage energy efficiency may be lower if other grid losses are considered.<br> * Section 6.1: Operating hours of appliances/equipment assumed to be at least 50% of daily occupancy hours in case the user does not mention the
