            <p>Welcome to the self assessment Building Energy Efficiency Calculator (BEEC). This tool was created under the
                framework
                of the Euroclima+ program by the Copenhagen Centre of Energy Efficiency (C2E2), an Energy Efficiency hub
                institutionally part of the UNEP
                DTU Partnership.<br><br> The Energy Sustainable Municipal Buildings project is funded by Euroclima +,
                the
                flagship cooperation program of the European Union for environmental sustainability and climate change
                in
                Latin
                America. In Argentina, the
                French Development Agency (AFD) is in charge of the implementation. The National University of La Plata
                (UNLP)
                is the entity responsible and leader of the project for its execution. The Red Argentina de Municipios
                frente al
                Cambio Climático (RAMCC)
                and the Copenhagen Center for Energy Efficiency (C2E2) are the strategic partners for the realization of
                the
                project.
                <br><br>

                <b>About BEET</b><br> This self assessment Building Energy Efficiency Calculator (BEEC) is designed to provide
                individual users a preliminary rapid assessment platform where they can assess their building energy
                performance. The overall objective of
                BEET is three fold:<br> a. Support the development of a rapid assessment of the energy performance of
                individual
                buildings;
                <br> b. Create a comparative evaluation between the baseline energy performance with energy efficiency
                (EE)
                standards.
                <br> c. Share recommendations of potential EE measures across building components and systems.
                <br> The tool is intended to cater to the needs of municipalities and relevant stakeholders. The tool
                may be
                used for overall understanding of impact on overall building energy consumption profile with respect to
                various
                system and component level
                parameters. The target users may be energy managers, analysts, maintenance and operation professionals,
                technicians and any individual with basic know-how on buildings and energy efficiency.

                        outcome on the building energy efficiency
                        based on the user's input data. The tool does not replace the simulations and assessments from a
                        full fledged
                        tools and licensed software
                        available in the market. The output results hence is recommended to be used for reference
                        purpose only and may
                        not be used for detailed or investment grade design and implementation activities.The tool is
                        built based
                        on technical literature
                        data, available global and local standards, tool developers' knowledge and experience in the
                        sector.

                        has
                        been taken to deliver the most possibly suitable platform. However, due to the challenges in
                        availability of
                        country specific data with
                        respect to climate files, building envelope standards, equipment and appliances, energy
                        efficiency
                        applications,
                        operations, technology and related resources, etc. we understand that there may be certain
                        differences
                        with
                        other similar available
                        online and licensed tools. All the assumptions have been listed in the Assumptions page.The
                        information
                        shared in this form will be used to asses the building performance and potential savings through

                                <li>Only average most common efficient values considered for comparison. However,
                                    relatively highest and better efficiency values are available in the market. Please
                                    reach out to us, if you come across such efficient values. We will review and
                                    integrate
                                    the same into the tool.</li>
                                <li> At times, average most efficient values are considered for calculation when the

                                    (inv) and summer (ver) are available. However the higher U values i.e. for summer
                                    are
                                    being considered for calculations when the user selects Option B or Option C for

                                    selects Option B i.e. "I don't know". Also, for electrical radiators, only equipment
                                    efficiency is considered as 100% since entire electricity input is converted to heat
                                    energy. However its real usage energy efficiency may be lower if other grid losses
                                    are
                                    considered.</li>

                                <li>For standardization and user guidance, Energy Performance Index (EPI) is calculated
                                    based on total built up area which is considered as carpet area + thickness of outer
                                    walls + balcony - parking area. However the cell does not prevent the user from

                                    any other forms of area for calculation. </li>
