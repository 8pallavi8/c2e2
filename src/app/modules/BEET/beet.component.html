    <p>Welcome to the self assessment Building Energy Efficiency Tool (BEET). This tool was created under the framework
        of the Euroclima+ program by the Copenhagen Centre of Energy Efficiency (C2E2), an Energy Efficiency hub
        institutionally part of the UNEP
        DTU Partnership.<br><br> The Energy Sustainable Municipal Buildings project is funded by Euroclima +, the
        flagship cooperation program of the European Union for environmental sustainability and climate change in Latin
        America. In Argentina, the
        French Development Agency (AFD) is in charge of the implementation. The National University of La Plata (UNLP)
        is the entity responsible and leader of the project for its execution. The Red Argentina de Municipios frente al
        Cambio Climático (RAMCC)
        and the Copenhagen Center for Energy Efficiency (C2E2) are the strategic partners for the realization of the
        project.

        <b>Euroclima+</b><br> Euroclima+ is an EU financed program that intends to promote climate change mitigation and
        adaptation actions in Latin American countries.<br> <br>

        <b>UNEP DTU Partnership (UDP)</b><br> UNEP DTU Partnership (UDP) is a leading international research and
        advisory institution on energy, climate and sustainable development. It is an independent Centre within the
        Department for Management at the
        Technical University of Denmark (DTU)
        <br><br>

        <b>About BEET</b><br> This self assessment Building Energy Efficiency Tool (BEET) is designed to provide
        individual users a preliminary rapid assessment platform where they can assess their building energy
        performance. The overall objective of
        BEET is three fold:<br> a. Support the development of a rapid assessment of the energy performance of individual
        buildings;
        <br> b. Create a comparative evaluation between the baseline energy performance with energy efficiency (EE)
        standards.
        <br> c. Share recommendations of potential EE measures across building components and systems.
        <br> The tool is intended to cater to the needs of municipalities and relevant stakeholders. The tool may be
        used for overall understanding of impact on overall building energy consumption profile with respect to various
        system and component level
        parameters. The target users may be energy managers, analysts, maintenance and operation professionals,
        technicians and any individual with basic know-how on buildings and energy efficiency.
    </p>

    <b>Disclaimer:</b>
    <p>The objective of the tool is to provide an indicative and holistic outcome on the building energy efficiency
        based on the user's input data. The tool does not replace the simulations and assessments from a full fledged
        tools and licensed software
        available in the market. The output results hence is recommended to be used for reference purpose only and may
        not be used for detailed or investment grade design and implementation activities. <br> The tool is built based
        on technical literature
        data, available global and local standards, tool developers' knowledge and experience in the sector. Care has
        been taken to deliver the most possibly suitable platform. However, due to the challenges in availability of
        country specific data with
        respect to climate files, building envelope standards, equipment and appliances, energy efficiency applications,
        operations, technology and related resources, etc. we understand that there may be certain differences with
        other similar available
        online and licensed tools. All the assumptions have been listed in the Assumptions page.<br> The information
        shared in this form will be used to asses the building performance and potential savings through energy
        efficient measures. Should there
        be any feedback / queries / suitable or customized data integration requirements, please do reach out to us at
