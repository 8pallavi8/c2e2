      "DESCRIPTION": "Welcome to the self assessment Building Energy Efficiency Calculator (BEEC). This tool was created under the framework of the Euroclima+ program by the Copenhagen Centre of Energy Efficiency (C2E2), an Energy Efficiency hub institutionally part of the UNEP DTU Partnership.<br _ngcontent-yoi-c353=\"\"><br _ngcontent-yoi-c353=\"\"> The Energy Sustainable Municipal Buildings project is funded by Euroclima +, the flagship cooperation program of the European Union for environmental sustainability and climate change in Latin America. In Argentina, the French Development Agency (AFD) is in charge of the implementation. The National University of La Plata (UNLP) is the entity responsible and leader of the project for its execution. The Red Argentina de Municipios frente al Cambio Clim√°tico (RAMCC) and the Copenhagen Center for Energy Efficiency (C2E2) are the strategic partners for the realization of the project. <br _ngcontent-yoi-c353=\"\"><br _ngcontent-yoi-c353=\"\"><b _ngcontent-yoi-c353=\"\">About BEEC</b><br _ngcontent-yoi-c353=\"\"> This self assessment Building Energy Efficiency Calculator (BEEC) is designed to provide individual users a preliminary rapid assessment platform where they can assess their building energy performance. The overall objective of BEEC is three fold:<br _ngcontent-yoi-c353=\"\"> a. Support the development of a rapid assessment of the energy performance of individual buildings; <br _ngcontent-yoi-c353=\"\"> b. Create a comparative evaluation between the baseline energy performance with energy efficiency (EE) standards. <br _ngcontent-yoi-c353=\"\"> c. Share recommendations of potential EE measures across building components and systems. <br _ngcontent-yoi-c353=\"\"> The tool is intended to cater to the needs of municipalities and relevant stakeholders. The tool may be used for overall understanding of impact on overall building energy consumption profile with respect to various system and component level parameters. The target users may be energy managers, analysts, maintenance and operation professionals, technicians and any individual with basic know-how on buildings and energy efficiency.",
      "DISCLAIMER": "Disclaimer",
      "DISCLAIMER-TEXT": "The objective of the tool is to provide an indicative and holistic outcome on the building energy efficiency based on the user's input data. The tool does not replace the simulations and assessments from a full fledged tools and licensed software available in the market. The output results hence is recommended to be used for reference purpose only and may not be used for detailed or investment grade design and implementation activities.The tool is built based on technical literature data, available global and local standards, tool developers' knowledge and experience in the sector. Care has been taken to deliver the most possibly suitable platform. However, due to the challenges in availability of country specific data with respect to climate files, building envelope standards, equipment and appliances, energy efficiency applications, operations, technology and related resources, etc. we understand that there may be certain differences with other similar available online and licensed tools. All the assumptions have been listed in the Assumptions page.The information shared in this form will be used to asses the building performance and potential savings through energy efficient measures.",
